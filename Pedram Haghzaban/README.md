Udacity VR class has been really interesting and challenging. I learned a lot about VR either for gaming or softwares.
Here are the list of the achievements in my final project:

Fundamentals:
Scale (100)
Animation (100)
Physics (100)
Lighting (100) Direction light is realtime and the lamp lighet is baked
Video Player (100) A video player added that shows the way to play bowling
Completeness:
Diegetic UI (250)
3D Modeling (250) I created the pins models via Blender
Photogrammetry (250) I took a picture of couple items and changed the settings to just be a plain color.
Challenges:
User Testing (500)


		 
User Testing:

	User 1 : 
		
Male 31 6’1”
Experience:  The height was too short. Lack of feeling about being in an island.
In order to fix: Increased the player height. Added music and more 3d objects to the game
User 2:

Female 25 5’5”
Experience: Water was plane so not feeling about being in an island. Dizziness.
Steps to fix the problems: Added waves. Changed camera speed and movement. 


Pre Prodution Idea:

The pre production idea was just a simple lane which player stays on and has access to a respawning 
ball and can throw it and get points based on pins down. After creating the desired setup, 
I asked 2 users to test and give me thei initial impressions(Listet above).
After their first impressions, I made the doable changes such as the island, music, waves and etc to give the player much better user exprience. 
The other idea I had to add was multiplayer option but due to lack of knowledge couldn't add it. 
One more thing that couldn't do due to lack of knowldege and equipment was edition in front the green screen.
But on final draft added video player to show the trick to play bowling, spatial sound from the torches, 
rains and also added the sound to pins when the ball his them or when they fall. 
The other thing that couldn't do in time was giving the ability to change the scene to the player.
